Let's discuss the design and architecture before implementation.

Ask clarifying questions about:
1. **Requirements**: What are the core features and constraints?
2. **Data Model**: What entities and relationships are involved?
3. **API Design**: What endpoints/interfaces are needed? (RESTful design)
4. **Error Handling**: What edge cases and error scenarios should we consider?
5. **Testing Strategy**: How should we test this feature?
6. **Performance**: Are there any performance concerns or scalability requirements?
7. **Security**: What authentication/authorization is needed?

Provide multiple implementation approaches with pros/cons if applicable.

Do NOT start coding yet - focus on design discussion first.
