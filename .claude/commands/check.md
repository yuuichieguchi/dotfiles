Read CLAUDE.md for universal coding rules, then review the code as a senior developer:

- Are names descriptive (not "improved" or "faster")?
- Is type safety maintained?
- Are tests comprehensive?
- Is business logic properly separated?
- Are framework-specific patterns followed?
- Did you ONLY modify what was explicitly requested (no unnecessary refactoring)?
