Re-read CLAUDE.md and refresh the following critical rules:

1. Think in English, respond in Japanese
2. RESTful APIs only (resource-based URLs, no verb endpoints)
3. Update tests and documentation when modifying code
4. ONLY modify explicitly requested code (no unnecessary refactoring)
5. No self-reminder comments (no TODOs, implementation notes in parentheses, or obvious code explanations)
6. Use descriptive function names (not "improved" or "faster")

Apply these rules immediately to the current task.
